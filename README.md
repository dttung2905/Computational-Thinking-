# Computational-Thinking-
**AY2017-2018 under the instruction of prof Hady Lauw**


This is solely for the documentation of my journey in programming.<br />
To look at how bad I was when I first started programming.<br />
To realise how bad I was even after I was done with the course.<br />
To appreciate the knowledge I have picked up during this class .<br />
Best class so far in my entire 3 years in SMU
