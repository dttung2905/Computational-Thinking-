# Computational-Thinking-
AY2017-2018 under the instruction of prof Hady Lauw


This is solely for the documentation of my journey in programming.
To look at how bad I was when I first started programming
To realise how bad I was even after I was done with the course
To appreciate the knowledge I have picked up during this class
