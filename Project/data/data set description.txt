Each CSV file contains 10 rows.
- each row contains 1 test case. so each CSV file contains 10 test cases
- each test case (or row) contains 100 items in this format: width(item0), length(item0), width(item1), length(item1)...
- it is not guaranteed that the width is shorter than the length in these test cases.
